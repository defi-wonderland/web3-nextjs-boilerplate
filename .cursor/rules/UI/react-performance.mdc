# React Performance Guidelines

## Optimization
- Implement proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Optimize re-renders
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Optimize images to be under 250kB

## State Management
- Use appropriate state management solutions
- Avoid unnecessary state
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use context API appropriately
