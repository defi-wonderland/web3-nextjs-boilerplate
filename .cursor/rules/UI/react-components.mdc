# React Component Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Abstract complex logic from render functions
- Keep render methods simple and declarative
- Split complex components into smaller ones
- Use hooks for side effects and state management

## Import Order
1. React imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Internal files

## Best Practices
- Use logical AND (`&&`) over ternary conditionals for clarity
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Avoid inline styles
